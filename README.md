UART Communication System with FIFO Buffer and Testbench

This project aims to implement a complete UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system in Verilog with FIFO buffering and a verification testbench.

The design includes:

  1. UART transmitter
  
  2. UART receiver
  
  3. FIFO buffer for transmit path
  
  4. Verilog testbench to verify functionality

The project is aimed at demonstrating digital design and functional verification, including data buffering, serial communication, and RTL simulation.
